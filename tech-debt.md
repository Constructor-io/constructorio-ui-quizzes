# Tech Debt

* Add Storybook
* Add stories for each component
* Infer types from client JS


# Open Questions

* The "select" type questions might have a cover image but it's not displayed in mock-ups. Should we support it? If yes, where should it go?
* Should we have a "themed" version along with the default skeleton?
