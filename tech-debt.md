# Tech Debt
* Add Storybook
* Add stories for each component
* Infer types from client JS


# Open Questions
* The "select" type questions might have a cover image but it's not displayed in mock-ups. Should we support it? If yes, where should it go?
* Should we have a "themed" version along with the default skeleton?
* Do we want to support consumers to pass in custom ids to target deeper divs in our components?
* Is there an accessibility guide we can follow? - Use the Storybook addon

# Concerns
* React's functional defaultProps might end up being deprecated. But they've been saying that since 2019. [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16210)
